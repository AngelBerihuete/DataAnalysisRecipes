\begin{abstract}
Probabilistic inference at its best gives probabilistic information
about parameters and models.  In many cases of importance---as with
experimental design or purchasing or delivery of results---it is
necessary to make a hard decision or choice.  It is almost never the
right move to choose the most probable model or option; it is rare
that the most probable is the option that delivers the most benefit to
the decider.  Instead the decider ought to specify a utility function
and work to optimize expected utility, or minimize expected loss, or
minimize maximal loss.  In real-world situations of building
experiments or operating an organization, to be generally useful the
utility must be specified in (the equivalent of) currency (dollar)
units.  The utility should be an approximation to the decider's
\emph{long-term future discounted free cash flow}.
