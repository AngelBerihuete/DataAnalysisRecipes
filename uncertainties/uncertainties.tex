\paragraph{Abstract:}

\section{Measurements and uncertainties}

Hello world.

Different ways of making a measurement: Bayes, max-like, rando estimator.

\section{The standard errors on a least-square fit}

Hello world. Linear fit.

Non-linear fit.

\section{Information theory}

Connection to Cram\'er--Rao bound and Fisher information.

\section{Bayes}

Foo

\section{Data simulation}

Hello world.

\section{Jackknife and bootstrap}

Hello world.

\section{Nuisance parameters}

Difference between marginalizing and profiling.

Identicality when it comes to the linear, Gaussian case.

What it looks like.

What it looks like in very nonlinear situations (like period fitting).

\section{Common mistakes and troubleshooting}

About 68\,percent of your values should be outside one sigma. What do think
or do if that's not true?

The uncertainty on the mean vs the distribution of values.

My data aren't well fit by my model; what does that mean for my uncertainty
analysis?

\section{Discussion}

Hello world.
