\begin{abstract}
  Here are the points I will make: Foo and bar.
\end{abstract}

I learned all this by doing it, in collaboration with others!

\paragraph{Science is a literature.}
Introduce ideas here of humanity, human choices, subjectivity, decision
theory, LTFDFCF, pragmatism, your audience, your career, and so on.

\paragraph{Be pragmatic.}
foo

\paragraph{Think about how the data were generated.}
Connect to causal structure, and hierarchical models.

\paragraph{State very clearly your assumptions.}
Once your assumptions are well specified, your method will flow naturally.
Note that you can't state \emph{all} of your assumptions.

\paragraph{Bring the model to the data.}
Don't correct the data, correct the model! Unless it gets very expensive.
Connects to pragmatism.

\paragraph{Binning is sinning.}
Any time you are binning, there is a regression-like alternative.
This also connects to bringing the model to the data!

\paragraph{Compare to information theory when you can.}

\paragraph{Use empirical uncertainty estimates and model validation.}
Bring up the mild conflict between this and the information-theory
point.

\paragraph{Don't make stuff up.}
Either use known methods, or else tailor your method to your carefully
specified beliefs (assumptions).

\paragraph{Stay close to the methodologists.}

\paragraph{Principled model selection requires a theory of decision-making.}

\paragraph{Don't commit to a philosophy.}
Use Bayes and frequentism as it makes sense.

\paragraph{Data analysis is subjective.}
Use this to bring together various threads from the above.
