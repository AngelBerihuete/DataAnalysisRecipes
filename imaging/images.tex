Like, so whatever.
\end{abstract}

... Images are intensity maps, not grids of flux buckets

... Calibration of images, photometric, astrometric, PSF, noise properties.  self-calibration.

... Likelihood functions are noise models
 
... ``Coadding'' is only justified in extremely limited circumstances

... Coadding prohibits certain kinds of investigations

... A measurement of something in an image is inference under a model, or an approximation thereto

... A model of a set of images is no harder, in principle, than a model of a single image

... Many images of the same scene give you more information about the scene than any one image

... How do we capitalize on these sets of images?  When they are taken in different bands and under different PSFs?

... What is a catalog and what is its relationship to an image?

... What about interferometry?  Michelson vs 

... What about 2-d spectroscopy?
