\begin{abstract}
  All the inference in this (nonexistent, never to be completed) book
  involves the comparison of models and data.  Here we lay out our
  specific meaning of the word ``model''; the short summary is that a
  model is an approximate but justified expression for (something
  proportional to) the probability of the data, usually as a function
  of model parameters.  This is also called a ``likelihood function''
  in many contexts.  Importantly, model specification requires
  specification of the noise properties of the data.  Many things
  conventionally described as ``models'' do not meet the criteria
  outlined here.
